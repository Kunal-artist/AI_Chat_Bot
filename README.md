The Language Learning Chatbot is an interactive tool designed to help users practice and improve their skills in a target language through conversational practice. Built using Python, it leverages OpenAI's language models via LangChain for natural language processing and SQLite for persistent storage of user mistakes. The bot supports learners at different proficiency levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) by providing tailored scenes, hints, feedback, and a session review.
